Then press ,g while cursor is on a class name word and
the file should open (you'll need the
source files and the path to have been set already).

Place cursor over a word and attempt to find a scala file with the give name.

The following matches are attempted:
 1) Is the cursor over a full package classname (e.g., scala.collection.Map)
    If so is it over the classname (Map)
      If so open it.
    Or it is over on of the package names (collection)
      If so open the directory (scala/collection).
 2) Is there a local file with the name <cword>.scala
    If so open it.
 3) Is there an import statement with that file identified explicitly
    (e.g., scala.collection.Map for Map).
    If so open it.
    If "locate" is enabled, search for file scala/collection/Map.scala (in this
    example). If found, open it.
 4) Is it a file located in "$JAVA_HOME/src/scala/lang/" directory
    If so open it.
 5) Is there an import statement with that file identified implicitly.
    (e.g., scala.collection.* for Map).
    If so open it. 
    If "locate" is enabled, search for file scala/collection/Map.scala (in this
    example). If found, open it.
 6) Its possible we are in a junit directory or is some parallel directory
    structure so that our current file has the same package statement
    value as some source files in a different directory. This attempt takes
    the package statement value, creates a directory plus scala file from
    it and first looks through the scala path and if not found there,
    does a "locate" searching for the file.

Also, can be configured to work with Java files (or with both Scala
and Java source files).
